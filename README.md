# Introduction
[**The Woodshed**](https://thewoodshed.herokuapp.com/)
is a React front-end multi-user file sharing application designed to allow musicians to share, like, and comment on PDF files relating to musical practice. The name of the site refers to the colloquial term *'woodshedding'* which is often used by musicians to mean spending time in the practice room. This originates in old jazz vernacular meaning the musician should go to the woodshed, a solitary place where no-one can hear you continually get it wrong for your sake and theirs(!), until they can play the passage correctly and are ready to return. In modern times the term is now used commonly to deonte spending time practicing.

In the digital age PDFs are common as resources amongst musicians and music teachers alike. And with the large demand for online music lessons increasing during the 2020 pandemic the demand to share resources online increase.

The Woodshed attempts to demonstrate a social-media-esq application for musicians and teachers to share musical and educational resources and grow a following of students and other musicians. The content shared could include anything from simple exercises, to whole pieces and scores. 

This site allows users to create an account, profile, and share PDF files as well as interact in the environment through likes, comments, and following users. 

The Woodshed has been created as the 5th portfolio project for the [Code Institue](https://codeinstitute.net) Full Stack Software Development Diploma and has no intended commerical purpose.
